# Deploying CouchDB with Ansible.

In this example we will simply deploy CouchDB via Ansible on the machine running GeneSIS or any other machine accessible via SSH. 

Here, we assume that (i) Ansible is up on the machine running GeneSIS, and (ii) GeneSIS is properly installed on the machine.

## Start GeneSIS:

First, letâ€™s start GeneSIS by using the following command in the root folder of GeneSIS:

        npm start

You should see the following message:

        > GeneSIS@0.0.1 start /Users/ferrynico/Documents/Code/GeneSIS-gitlab/GeneSIS
        > node ./app.js
        
        2019-02-18T09:03:41.393Z - [info]: Engine started!
        2019-02-18T09:03:41.404Z - [info]: PlantUML diagram generator started on port: 8080
        2019-02-18T09:03:41.406Z - [info]: MQTT server listening on port 1883
        2019-02-18T09:03:41.407Z - [info]: Magic happens on port 8880

Once GeneSIS started, you can access the GeneSIS editor at the following address:

        http://127.0.0.1:8880
