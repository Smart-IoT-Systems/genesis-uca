GeneSIS - Generation, orchestration and deployment of Smart IoT Systems

In the past years, multiple tools have emerged to support the building as well as the automated and continuous deployment of software systems with a specific focus on cloud infrastructures (e.g., Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Vagrant, Brooklyn, CloudML, etc.). However, very little effort has been spent on providing solution for the delivery and deployment of application across the whole IoT, edge and cloud space. In particular, there is a lack of languages and abstractions that can be used to support the orchestration of software services and their deployment on heterogeneous devices.

GeneSIS aims to facilitate the engineering and continuous deployment of smart IoT systems, allowing decentralized processing across heterogeneous the IoT, edge and cloud space. GeneSIS includes: (i) a domain specific modelling language to model the orchestration and deployment of smart IoT systems across the IoT, edge and cloud spaces; and (ii) an execution engine that will support the orchestration of IoT, edge and cloud services as well as their automatic deployment over IoT, edge and cloud resources.
